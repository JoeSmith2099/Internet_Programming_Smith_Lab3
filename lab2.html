  <h3>Lab 2 Instructions</h3>
<p>You will log into your repl.it account, fork your lab 1 repl.it to create a Repl.it for lab two. Copy index and rename it lab 2. Create a new page for lab 2. Then you will write code to turn index.html into the main page of a labs portfolio. Add navigation hyperlinks so the user can surf to all lab pages and back to index. The navigation should be on every page. Put the instructions for lab 1 on the lab 1 page. Put the instructions for lab 2 on the lab 2 page. Remember all text needs to be in a tag. On the index page add some text saying welcome to your CPSC 2125 Labs 1-6 portfolio. You fork and add to this for labs 3, 4, 5, and 6.
